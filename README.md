# Chess
My computer version of chess

You can run the game form whichever Java IDE you prefer.
Before running in order to run you have to change some pathnames in Chess/src/com/startup/GridLayoutManager.java.
You have to change the IMGs pathnames so they are correct for your computer. After that if you run the game it should work.

Attention: The white pieces should play first!
